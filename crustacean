1st of all na 
pop site kama crustacean
into night shine bright 
All the bulbs in
Na love inalast 
kama polythene
na hope unishike love
New police case in

New blaster pop star
Am frozen in
New muscles I get them
Without the gym
On toes small half socks
And I pocket in
Baebi baebi calling
Says shez the meal

inside 
Am frozen out inside in


Option 1 glow bright, supernova beam
magma hot lava left where mic should have been
built from scratch empire up no blueprint
got a call me they want what overseas need

Spittin' fire so hot, melt the mic where it flows
Built this empire from scratch, no blueprint, just the hustle
Now I stunt in foreign whips, leaves your pockets lookin' dusty

Option 2: Confident & Motivational

Doubt whispers in my ear, but I silence it with beats
Inner strength on overdrive, my hustle never retreats
Used to trip on setbacks, now I learn and jump ahead
Eyes on the prize, focused sharp, no time for doubt fed

Option 3: Playful & Energetic

Got the whole crowd jumpin', ain't no room for standin' still
Bass thumpin' through the floor, feel the vibe, it gives you chills
Lyrics twist and turn, mind blown by the wordplay
This ain't your average tune, it's a party all the way
