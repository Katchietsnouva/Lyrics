Maybe I should have made myself understand early you were done with me
Maybe I shouldnt have struggled tryna make ends meet
Maybe I should have never have even tried to stick to you
Maybe I should have given myself the name reject
Maybe I should have assured myself you were thinking of someone else
I now feel embarrassed I told you I dreamt you and me move to a better life
And you laughed

Maybe I told myself I'll never let them take you away from me
You told me to my face you arent mine
I should never consider you as my own
Am still practising to detach
Still coming to terms never be obsessed again

pliz dont tamper me
don don don don tamper me.

Thats ok I moved on
I changed you never notice 
So that means am still fake 
But thats all right coz
my material is quality

Nowadays I prefer if a girl even pretends to love me. 
I find comfort in the pretence
