is it coming
am ready ready
lets girrit  

Bro are you  the wheel
Are you gon crush the melody
Right      
Give me the keys to the booth

Myself on the mic
Dj Neons
You know

Paint on my face paint on my facce  
Not that you care but this madness
Ok ok 
    
restart the drive
restart the drive what do you know about engines
Alright Ok give me the diesel
the diesel


Pooo
Rough on the ride its my  floor
I show u a truck drive widget
Baby Girl wants me in her video
Says a man in a two 
Firelight
lets talk about water
In future we switch to fuel
Jumpin in the air x2 coz I wrote about water

My life on the run 
if i stop is on the poodium
I need your phone lights on 
I live my life on the concrete
U grabba i crush with my hand
Treating people like donkey
with a deep tone like an an
With a deep tone like a domney

Me in love with horse power
free the power
whatever i do engine push harder
even with things exploding i no put cover
loving horse power gears grinding harder
Look at the brand, past tense were badder
Give me the puzzle titanium harder

Like a dorm light in the night
Where dreams take flight guided by light
Whispers of hope floating in the air
A sanctuary where worries repair


Deeply in love with the diesel
Says a man say a man double two two roll
Whose road is a vicious circle


Is a girl who wants me in her video  
Is a grl who wants to take me with her a video

     ride  wooo
