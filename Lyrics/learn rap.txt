[Chorus]
They try claim they had my back
Them boys couldn't name me a time and date
I got broski back, whatever the situation gimme time and place
I been working on trust and again
They don't know about the time it takes
And I've always been DTB, I've never been CLB like Drake
[Verse]
I can't live a normal life no more
This shit got me wishin' I hid my face
I ain't been getting no sleep on a regular
Think it's because of the money I chase
Gotta make sure that everyone eats
Need to put food on my family plates
Whеn bro shoulda been in school
He was puttin' numbers in a shit
Yo, I put all of my heart into passion
I said I would blow, but thеy were tellin' me "No"
I'm guessing, they must have been cappin'
Bae been upset that I ain't been present
'Cah I been focusin' on the rappin'
But I need to leave the hood soon 'cause the block too hot like tuna
Gotta get bread, no room to be slappin'
Yo, so many sleepless nights
Grind don't stop till the whole gang eatin' right
You weren't there when I had no cake, but you're thinkin' of gettin' a slice
Ever since I been handle with fame, I been duckin' from evil eye
And them girls that were movin' tight
Told them that there's been a change in price

[Chorus]
They try claim they had my back
Them boys couldn't name me a time and date
I got broski back, whatever the situation gimme time and place
I been working on trust and again
They don't know about the time it takes
And I've always been DTB, I've never been CLB like Drake
They try claim they had my back
Them boys couldn't name me a time and date
I got broski back, whatever the situation gimme time and place
I been working on trust and again
They don't know about the time it takes
And I've always been DTB, I've never been CLB like—

----------------------------PART 2--------------------------
[Intro]
(X10)
Yo, ay, look, ay

[Verse 1]
I thought about quitting and I came back hard
I told bro, I'ma be in the charts
Never really thought I would come this far
I took so many L's in the way
And it took man a minute to better my craft
I was doing up F with the mandem
Now I'm with Meeks with the head of Atlantic
Shaking hands with the A&R
I Swear I couldn't care about the fame or followers
I need me a million funds
And I really deserve that shit
All that time and work, I did on my ones
Needed a friend couldn't find me none (Huh)
You were calling for help, I couldn't say no, I was getting it done
But you there in the vibe and the party's turnt
I can't dеal with no fake ass love on my crew
No cap, I rathеr be hated
And I'm glad that I never gave up
I stood my ground and patiently waited
If the label ain't talking 7 figures, I'm not persuaded
There was times where I was never rated
And I'm due to be suttin' on the stages
[Chorus]
Feel like I'm trapped in this London city
I just pray that I make it out
I been focusing on getting my pound
But this generation only care about clout
When I was flat on my face, In need of a mate
I clearly had no one around
It's funny now man's on top
I just wanna make mumzy proud

[Verse 2]
I shoulda kicked ball like Rashford
But I'm too hard when it comes to the rap
I'm in the booth tryna get me a plaque
'Cah bro's OT still serving crack
We ain't never lived no sweet life
I got my codies back like Zack
I ain't buying no watch or chain
If I ain't giving my mumzy racks
Need me a bae that will keep it real
Stay with the kid, if I caught me a felony
But I said that I'm DTB, pain in my heart
I'm in need of a remedy
You can get cut right off, no cap
If I don't fuck with your energy
He was hating on the low
My own bredrin turned to a enemy
I hated on the fact that I was doing up F
When the rap weren't giving me bread
And them times that I shoulda been studying for my exams
I chose to make money instead
When I was sitting, in times of need
I didn't receive one call or text
She was fucking with me for the clout
That's a reason I hate my ex
[Chorus]
Feel like I'm trapped in this London city
I just pray that I make it out
I been focusing on getting my pound
But this generation only care about clout
When I was flat on my face, In need of a mate
I clearly had no one around
It's funny now man's on top
I just wanna make mumzy proud
Feel like I'm trapped in this London city
I just pray that I make it out
I been focusing on getting my pound
But this generation only care about clout
When I was flat on my face, In need of a mate
It's funny now man's on top
I just wanna make mumzy proud
