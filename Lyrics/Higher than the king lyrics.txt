Higher than the king lyrics



my name is katchiets 
and I feel the need 
to be higher than I ever need

so I fuck up my beam 
to throw up the zeal
so I link my heart to the engine

Yes 
I just pray just to be blessed 
Yes 
Fight for what i got to impress
Yes
Look at who i invest

My shoes got the flight to be the best


you know
i got my self off my floor


put myself in a throne or a comma 


Tell my mother my prevoius was weaker than the Samson who is much stronger

tell her to please watch me go up
{go up}


or a trauma
